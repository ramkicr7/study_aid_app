Innovation in education today caters to the need for making learning easier, more visual, and accessible for every student—from kindergarten through competitive examinations. This paper presents an artificial intelligence-powered educational assistant that turns traditional text-based study material into interesting animated explanations. The system integrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction, Gemini API for intelligent content narration generation, and a custom video synthesis module that creates contextually appropriate animated visualizations.This application utilizes FastAPI as the backend and Streamlit for testing, capable of processing photos, PDFs, or camera-captured book pages as input to automatically generate storytelling videos for educational content. The work aims to support learners who struggle with static text comprehension by providing dynamic, story-based visual learning experiences. A comparative study of similar AI educational systems and available deep learning-based narration generation techniques shows that integrating OCR with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini significantly enhances contextual accuracy and comprehension.
